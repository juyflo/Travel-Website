               <h1>Let's go to New York</h1>
                <p>New York City comprises 5 boroughs sitting where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean. At its core is Manhattan, a densely populated borough that’s among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers. Its iconic sites include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and sprawling Central Park. Broadway theater is staged in neon-lit Times Square.</p>

                 <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
                 <h3>Crown Shy</h3>
                 <p>This 2019 opening was longtime chef de cuisine at Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park James Kent’s first solo venture. Crown Shy still turns out excellent food and beautiful cocktails in an elegant environment that’s equal parts special occasion destination and nicer-than-normal evening whim. Its upstairs neighbor Overstory is also sensational for drinks with a view after dinner.</p>
                 <h3>Dhamaka</h3>
                 <p>The unstoppable Unapologetic Foods team spotlights what they refer to as “the forgotten side of India,” including gurda kapoora (goat kidney, testicles, red onion and pao) doh khleh (pork with lime, cilantro, onion and ginger) and champaran meat (mutton, garlic, red chili). The group has continued opening new venues since Dhamaka, including Rowdy Rooster, which serves the best new fried chicken sandwich in NYC. See its coming attractions on our list of the most anticipated restaurant openings of fall, 2022. </p>
